                        <p>Commercial scale butanol production using Clostridium sp. suffers from key limitations: solvent toxicity and low butanol titer. To that end, present work aims to offset these limitations through combined metabolic engineering, system biology and process engineering approaches. As a result, a sustainable and scalable bioprocess with in situ solvent recovery will be developed using a butanol overproducing Clostridium strain with improved solvent tolerance.</p>

                        <p>Biochemical networks are the complex and central processing units of life. The principal components in the unit are metabolites which interact physically and chemically to produce various products. A metabolic pathway is defined as a series of enzymatic reactions that produce specific product (Voet & Voet 1997). To enhance the productivity, a prior knowledge of the pathway (metabolic flux) is necessary. Stoichiometry based modeling facilitates the complete analysis of the entire metabolic network but they are impotent to represent the dynamic behavior of the biological system.</p>

                        <p>Zymomonas mobilis is a promising organism for biofuel production as it can efficiently produce ethanol at rates greater than those reported for yeast. However, the organism suffers from a disadvantage - it does not possess the necessary genes for utilizing pentose sugars. When these genes are introduced from other organisms, it is able to ferment arabinose and xylose in a sequential manner, leading to long processing times. This sequential utilization is not due to regulation or an inherent hierarchy but due to inefficient transport of pentose sugars. This proposal aims to address issues related to effective, simultaneous transport of sugars. The project is implemented through DBT-Pan IIT center for Bioenergy and in collaboration with Dr. Supreet Saini of IIT Bombay.</p>

                        <p>Large scale production of algal biomass for commercial application is recommended to be obtained mostly in open, "raceway" pond or closed photobioreactor via photoautotrophic cultivation. However, this commonly used way of algal cultivation suffers from various limitations. To address these existing bottlenecks we propose to use Photovoltaic Airlift Photobioreactor (PAPB) for high cell density cultivation of microalgae using natural light source (sunlight) in a closed environment. An Energy Efficient Electrochemical Harvesting (EEECH) technology is being developed to minimize the cost on downstream process. We are also interested to develop sustainable pilot scale production technology for hydrocarbon oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae grown on flue gas and organic nutrients recycled from HTL unit which will be economically feasible and environmentally safe.</p>

                        <p>we seek to achieve a deeper understanding of the interaction between growth and product formation, biochemical energy, carbon fixation and assimilation pathway. Our group is performing a combined task of biochemical characterization, comparative proteomic study and flux balance analysis of the model algal strain grown under various growth conditions in order to identify the key process parameters, regulatory proteins and dominant pathways which could be the possible targets for modifications. Based on the findings we will propose a strategy to improve overall performance of the technology via combined modifications at the process (Biochemical engineering approach) and strain level (genetic engineering approach). This work is in collaboration with Dr. Sanjeeva Srivastava, Department of Bioscience and Bioengineering, IIT Bombay.</p>
